Christoffel’s Dining Experience

Christoffel’s Dining Experience is a pastel-inspired dining menu app built using React Native and Expo. The project demonstrates my understanding of mobile app development concepts, focusing on layout design, user interaction, and functional programming in TypeScript.

Purpose

This application allows users or restaurant staff to manage a digital menu. It includes features to:

Add new dishes with a name, category, description, and price

View a full menu displayed clearly by category

Remove dishes from the list when needed

Filter menu items by course, such as Starters, Mains, Dessert, or Drinks

The goal was to create an organised, user-friendly experience that reflects both design and functionality.

Design Concept

The app uses a soft pastel pink background paired with matte gold accents to create a warm and refined dining atmosphere. The visual theme was inspired by modern cafés and restaurant menus that balance simplicity and elegance.

Technologies Used

React Native (Expo) – used to build and run the app on mobile

TypeScript – for structured, type-safe coding

React Navigation – for the bottom tab navigation between screens

Expo Go – for testing on real devices

Features

Add and delete dishes from the menu

Categorise dishes by course

Filter menu items by category

Basic validation to prevent incorrect inputs

Consistent UI across all screens
